            “We want to build an AI app” is exciting energy. It’s also the fastest
            way to accidentally design a 3-year project. The key to
            <strong>custom AI app development</strong> that actually ships is
            ruthless scoping.
          </p>

          <h2>Define a single success moment</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of “We want an AI assistant for our company,” frame it like:
          </p>
          <p>
            “Success is when a support agent can click one button and get a draft
            reply to a customer email.”
          </p>

          <h2>Limit yourself to one persona</h2>
          <p>
            Don’t try to serve sales, support, ops, and leadership on day one.
            Pick one role, one workflow, and design the first version around
            that.
          </p>

          <h2>Pick boring tech on purpose</h2>
          <p>
            Your goal isn’t to win architecture awards. It’s to launch. An
            <strong>AI SaaS studio</strong> like CodeAura will usually reach for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A simple backend (often Python + Flask)</li>
            <li>An LLM provider like Gemini</li>
            <li>A basic database and auth system</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Ship a version that feels tiny (and that’s good)</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re slightly embarrassed by how small V1 is, you’re probably on
            the right track. You can always layer in more flows, analytics, and
            UI later.
          </p>

          <h2>Need help scoping?</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re stuck at the “idea soup” stage, CodeAura can help turn your
            idea into a clear one-page scope with timelines and cost ranges.
