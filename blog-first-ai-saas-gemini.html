            CozyReply, an AI-powered reply tool for Airbnb hosts, started as a
            simple idea: “What if hosts could get a warm, on-brand reply in one
            click?” It became my first real <strong>AI SaaS MVP</strong> built
            with Gemini and shipped in under 30 days.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 1 – Pick one tiny, painful problem</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of trying to build a full “AI platform for hospitality,” I
            focused on a single workflow:
            <strong>replying to Airbnb messages quickly</strong> while still
            sounding human.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 2 – Choose a simple stack</h2>
          <p>The stack for the first version was intentionally boring:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Python + Flask for the backend</li>
            <li>Gemini for generating message drafts</li>
            <li>Stripe for subscriptions</li>
            <li>Plain HTML/CSS for the frontend</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Because the scope was small and clear, there was no need for heavy
            frameworks or huge infrastructure. The goal was to
            <strong>build an AI MVP fast</strong>, not to impress other devs.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 3 – Limit the feature set on purpose</h2>
          <p>
            The first version did one thing well: take a guest message, apply
            the host’s tone and rules, and generate a draft reply. That’s it.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 4 – Ship, then refine</h2>
          <p>
            Once real hosts were using it, I adjusted prompts, tweaked the UI,
            and added small quality-of-life improvements instead of giant new
            features. This is how CodeAura likes to handle
            <strong>custom AI app development</strong> in general: ship first,
            then refine based on real usage.
          </p>

          <h2>Thinking about your own AI SaaS?</h2>
          <p>
            If you’ve got an idea for a small AI SaaS, you don’t need a huge
            platform. You need a clear problem, a tiny scope, and a partner to
            help you build the first version.
          </p>
