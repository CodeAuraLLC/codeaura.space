          <p>
            If you’re a founder without a technical background, “AI automation
            studio” can sound intimidating. You know you want to use AI to save
            time, but you don’t want to drown in jargon or commit to a giant
            platform.
          </p>

          <h2>They start with your workflow, not their tech stack</h2>
          <p>
            A good studio spends more time asking how your business works than
            talking about models and frameworks. The goal is
            <strong>custom AI app development</strong> built around
            <em>your actual processes</em>.
          </p>

          <h2>They suggest small, testable projects</h2>
          <p>
            Beware of anyone who wants to rebuild your entire business on day
            one. Look for a studio that recommends:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>One automation or tool to start</li>
            <li>Clear success criteria</li>
            <li>A timeline measured in weeks, not years</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>They explain things in normal language</h2>
          <p>
            If you constantly feel dumb in conversations, that’s a red flag. A
            good <strong>AI consulting</strong> partner will translate complexity
            into plain English and show you diagrams, not just buzzwords.
          </p>

          <h2>They document and hand off cleanly</h2>
          <p>
            You should end a project with clear docs, not just a black box.
            That’s something we care about a lot at CodeAura: small systems,
            clean hand-offs, and tools that are easy to maintain.
          </p>

          <h2>Looking for a studio?</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re a non-technical founder who wants AI in your business
            without becoming a full-time engineer, CodeAura might be a fit. Tell
            us what you’re trying to automate and we’ll help you scope something
            realistic.
